This repo includes ongoing work on numerical methods for optimal control of open quantum systems for continuous-variable quantum error correction. The jaxpulse class may be of interest for JAX-based quantum simulation (built on the excellent new library dynamiqs) of optimal control schemes. It includes autodiff-enabled pulse optimization schemes with a variety of pulse shapes and customizability.
